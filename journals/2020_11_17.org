** It should now be the case that everyone in the [[https://github.com/exp2exp][Exp2Exp]] org on Github can edit pages here.
** I'm thinking about importing my notes from the "grant development" Org Roam so that these can seed the network. I suppose I'll try that now!  I was able to bring in [[Grants Index]] via Git commit and that's now integrated here.
** Got the other pages integrated too. Linking has to be `[[Like this]]` not `[[file:like_this.org][Like this]]` to work, and it seems like links should also be inside the high-level bullet points not free text in order to show up in the graph. (Oh, and their parser doesn't seem to DTRT on this line.)
** Next step is to try and break them down logically some more (actual work not just technical plumbing!)
